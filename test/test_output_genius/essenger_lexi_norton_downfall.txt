I didn't see the signs
Thought I'd found a way out
You caught me with those eyes
I'm thinking I should leave now
A couple words won't hurt
"So what're you doing downtown?"
You tell me how you've been
And now my head won't slow down

I shouldn't stay
But can't help but wonder
I hate the way (I love the way)
That you pull me under
I know I've made mistakes
But this could be my downfall
You could be my downfall
You could be my downfall

I didn't mean to stare
Couldn't help but notice
A part of me still cares
But it's over and you know this
I shouldn't feel this way
You're fucking with my head now
A couple drinks too late
You got me thinking out loud

I shouldn't stay (I shouldn't stay)
But can't help but wonder
I hate the way (I love the way)
That you pull me under
I know I've made mistakes
But this could be my downfall
You can be my downfall
You could be my downfall

Don't try to tell me this is nothing
Say it with your hands on my face
Don't try to tell me this is nothing
I can count the reasons with my eyes closed
Calling out your name
I'll find a reason with my eyes closed
(But I know that you'll come back to haunt me)
And you can be my downfall
(You can be my downfall)

I shouldn't stay
But can't help but wonder
I hate the way (I love the way)
That you pull me under
I know I've made mistakes
But this could be my downfall
You could be my downfall
