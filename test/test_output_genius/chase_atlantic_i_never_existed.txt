(Yeah)
You know I love it when you say it's all for me (Oh yeah)
I know you're lying but it don't make a difference (A difference, oh)
And I know you ain't praying when you get on the floor for me, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
It's how I know that you've been feeling the distance (The distance)

But it's temporary
Oh, it's necessary
So let me show you just a couple little things you can do when you're with him

I know you always say you'd give him away for me (Away for me)
But I ain't never been the one for commitment (Commitment)
I'm gonna leave you either way if you stay with me, ooh yeah (Ooh yeah)
So go and tell him that I never existed (I never existed)
(I never existed)
(I never existed)

Yeah, yeah
I hope you're ready to be taking the fall for me (The fall for me, yeah)
Cause we can do it if you're willing to risk it (Risk it, yeah)
And I don't wanna hear it if it ain't involved with me (Involved with me, yeah)
Cause your relationship is none of my business (None of my business)

But he's ordinary
You need more than that
So let me show you just a couple little things you can do when you're with him (You can do, you can do, yeah)

I know you always say you'd give him away for me (Away for me)
But I ain't never been the one for commitment (Commitment)
I'm gonna leave you either way if you stay with me, ooh yeah (Ooh yeah)
So go and tell him that I never existed (I never existed)
(You can tell him that I never existed)
(I never existed)

Uh, and you don't need to say it, I can tell that you're professional
Cause you've had my attention for a while now (While now)
But don't think that I'm staying, I'm just here for the confessional
So you can take the pressure when he finds out, ayy
So go and take me off of your wish list
Gone cause I'm keeping my distance
So go and tell him that I never existed

I know you always say you'd give him away for me (Away for me)
But I ain't never been the one for commitment (Commitment)
I'm gonna leave you either way if you stay with me, ooh yeah (Ooh yeah)
So go and tell him that I never existed
(Yeah)
