I'm holding on to this world
But somehow everything feels so surreal
I'm holding on to thin air
Until now I can't tell if you're there
My trembling arms and trembling frame
Can't shake my aim, can't shake my game

Just let me go
I'm losing control

Open up your eyes and see
This whole new reality
My hold onto this dream
Is slipping, I'm bursting at the seams
I just want to be free
From this artificial world I'm in

I just want to be free
I just want to be free
From this artificial world I'm in

I'm losing control
(I just want to be free)
I'm losing control
(I just want to be free)
I'm losing control
(I just want to be free)
I'm losing control
