Blood is always dripping down her throat
It's hard to wipe that smile off her face
Sodium runs deep inside her nose
She fill the void with fashion and cocaine, yuh
Bitches try to copy, I see 'em, yuh
Chase that shot of Henny with tears, uh
Don't base the emotion off fear
She'll take my attention, nothing less

She said "Ooh
Dance with me one more time, boy
And tell me that I'll make it through, yuh
Just tell me I'll be alright boy
Tell me what's the point in living?
Tell me"
wefwefwef
"Ooh," it's alright
I'll make sure to make it by, for one night, yeah
But then let me die
Ooh, it's alright, babe
The diamonds will take your life
But don't cry, uh
There's beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, oh, no, no, no, no, no
Said I find beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, oh, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah

Seven grams buried in an ashtray, eh
You should see her on a bad day
Give two fucks what her mother or her dad say, eh
Tell me, what's up with the sad face?
Baby gets high when she wanna
Fights on the come up
Closet full of Louis V, Giuseppe and Prada
Heart cold "Indiana", strong marijuana
She filled up her lungs and screamed

"Oh, I don't wanna end up on the news
These self-inflictions tend to cut me loose
And lights they lead me home, they lead my loneliness"
She said "What's the point in living?
Tell me"

"Ooh," it's alright
I'll make sure to make it by, for one night, yeah
But then let me die
Ooh, it's alright, babe
The diamonds will take your life
But don't cry, uh
There's beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, ooh, no, no
Said I find beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, ooh, no, no
Yeah, yeah

Oh, beauty in death sometimes
No, you've never been this high
It might make you lose your mind
Lose your mind
Let it fly
Diamonds will make her blind, oh
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste your time
Beauty in death, sometimes

"Ooh," it's alright, yeah, uh
I'll make sure to make it by, for one night, yeah, uh
But then let me die
Ooh, it's alright, babe, yeah
The diamonds will take your life
But don't cry, yeah
There's beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Ooh, don't cry
The diamonds will take your life
But don't cry, yeah
Cause I find beauty in death sometimes

Yeah, I find beauty in death sometimes
That's why there's angels in the sky
Yeah, I find beauty in death
