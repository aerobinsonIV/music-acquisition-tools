She's been down the darkest roads
She's been all alone, yeah
Strangers seem to come and go
Helps her business grow, yeah
Daddy didn't want your love, he fucked you up
He lost your love, he took your heart
Yeah, yeah
She put a price on her body
You want it, you pay up, yeah-yeah
A trip to Dubai or Miami
All so she can lay up, yeah-yeah

Well, business is business
And girl, I know you're on your way up
Baby, wait up
If you're gonna fuck him for money
Make sure he don't play up

She said
"Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free," yeah
"Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free," yeah
You're doing acrobatics with your body
Let the money fall like those leaves, yeah
You told me that you're done with this life
But your friends all disagree, yuh, oh-oh

"I can give you love for free," yuh-yuh
She said, "Babe, I can give you love for free," yuh, yuh
She said, "Yeah, I can give you love for free," no-no, oh, yuh
Girl, I got what you need, no, oh-oh

The penthouse we rented
Said, "I love you," I meant it
The view was expensive
So you show me affection
And I know you're stuck in your ways
Usually wanna get paid
Usually nothing to say
Usually grams to the face, but
Old friend, new friend
Where the fuck's the balance? Yeah
Backstabbing black hearts
Followed you from Dallas, yeah-yeah

But business is business
And girl, you know you're on your way up
Baby, wait up
If you're gonna fuck him for money
Make sure he don't play up

She said
"Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free," yeah
"Baby, come and work for me
I can give you love for free," yeah
You're doing acrobatics with your body
Let the money fall like those leaves, yeah
You told me that you're done with this life
But your friends all disagree, yuh, oh-oh

"I can give you love for free," yeah, yeah
She said, "Babe, I can give you love for free," yeah, yeah
She said, "Yeah, I can give you love for free," no-no, oh no
Girl, I got what you need, no-oh

Drifting away, yuh
Drifting away
She's sick of this place
New man everyday
She wants a new life to live
She wants to feel safe, yeah
Driftin'
One needle is enough to make a difference
She needs way more than love
She needs commitments, yeah
I'll sail you away, babe
Let's fuck off this place, yeah
And we can keep on driftin'

Driftin'
Driftin'
Driftin'
Yuh
