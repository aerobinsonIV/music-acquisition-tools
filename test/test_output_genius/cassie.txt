The writing's on the wall right now
And I'm way too involved somehow
Shit, I probably tore her heart right out
At least that's how it feels right now (Yeah)

But we're holding on, we're holding on
We say some words, we land them wrong
Say what you need, then move along
She said, "It's seven in the morning, what'd you take me for?"

Cassie's been waiting too long
The drug in her veins is too strong
She fell in love with the medicine she's on
Yeah, in a matter of minutes, her mind's gone
Cassie's been waiting too long
Cassie's been waiting too long

It's kinda hard to deal out there
There's way too many feels out there
She said, "Not if you're a millionaire"
And I swear I fell in love right there (Yeah)

We take it off, we take it all
She'll get me high, but at a cost
I see it in her eyes, that girl is lost
But Cassie, if you stay with me, I'll never stop

Cassie's been waiting too long
The drug in her veins is too strong
She fell in love with the medicine she's on
Yeah, in a matter of minutes, her mind's gone
Cassie's been waiting too long
Cassie's been waiting too long

She built a world with her own two hands
Well, just give that a thought
And she don't ever want to make no plans
Cause she don't go outside no more
She left a dent in my heart as she drove with her car into my life, though
She tilts her head to the side, what a night, yeah
But Cassie, don't you overdose
